## Restrain add-on

The standard Vaadin component API only let's you specify the width and height of them, but not minimum or maximum width and height.

The Restrain extension fixes that, and allows you to easily specify all of those with a server API.

Notice: the min/max sizes donâ€™t always work together with the Vertical and Horizontal layout expand rations. This is a known limitation set by the implementation details in the core layouts.
